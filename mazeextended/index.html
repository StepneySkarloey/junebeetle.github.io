			<h2>Maze Extended</h2>
			<p>A complete re-implementation of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/77278452/">my rather popular Scratch game</a>, Maze. Experience the same puzzle, but with more sophisticated graphics (scrolling, yay!), slightly less boring music, and waaay more detailed instructions. Oh, and also, a 3x larger map! Hence the "extended" part. If you liked the first one but found it a bit easy, you'll enjoy Maze Extended. It's also the first publicly available preview of my new platformer engine, written in <a href="http://processing.org">Processing 3</a> (a Java-based language and IDE).

It's currently in Alpha, so expect some glitches, although nothing much worse than anything in the Scratch one. Download a copy for your platform and try it out! Then, <a href="/contact/">tell me what you think</a>.

Since it's made in Processing, Maze Extended requires Java to run properly. The downloads that have a Java runtime included are much more likely to work, but also much larger. I recommend that you download these unless you have very slow internet, or you're certain that you have the latest version of Java.</p>
