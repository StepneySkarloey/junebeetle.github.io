This is a simple program for editing the Flash game Boxheads 2 Play by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/stcg.games">Sean Cooper</a>. It allows you to design a custom map and then play it. Using a simple graphical user interface, you can place any objects that exist in the real game. Then, click "Save SWF" to export a copy of Boxheads with the "Boxy" map replaced by your custom one. You can also save your map as a simple binary file containing the data. You can import this file again to continue editing the map.

When you make your map, be sure that it has many player, zombie, and devil spawn points.</p>
