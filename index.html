			<p>Hi! I'm Will, otherwise known as junebeetle! Welcome to my small and mediocre website.

You're probably looking for my Scratch to SWF converter. <a href="/converter/">Here</a> it is.

As of December 2016, I've added quite a few new pages, and they no longer all fit in the top menu, so I've had to move them around a bit. Check out the <a href="/index/">list of other pages</a> to see all of the new stuff, as well as everything that used to be on the top menu. I'm still playing with the layout, and I plan to continue to add some more pages, mostly about my interests in:

- Advanced Scratch topics
- Web design and coding
- My rather overly massive operating system collection
- <s>Mac OS X</s> macOS (and how it's way better than Windows)
- Adobe Flash, ActionScript 3, and Flash games

I also have a lot of semi-completed projects that I hope to finish up the near future. Expect old Mac OS installation tutorials, barely-functional Flash games, and some Hackintosh related posts, as well as whatever other random stuff I come across on my hard drive and decide to upload.

Thanks for visiting! Have an awesome day, and don't <a href="http://losethegame.com/">lose the game</a>!</p>
