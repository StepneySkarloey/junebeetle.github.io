      <h2>Welcome to my new website!</h2>
      <p>For a while, I've wanted to learn to design and write a website from scratch. Thanks to <a href="http://000webhost.com">000webhost</a>'s free hosting service, I've finally been able to realize that dream. Over the next few weeks, I'll be gradually migrating my Scratch to SWF converter stuff from my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/junebeetle23">Google Site</a> to this website. Then, I'll start writing some more pages, mostly about my interests in:
<br>
<br>- Scratch
<br>- Web design
<br>- Old operating systems
<br>- Mac OS X
<br>- AppleScript
<br>- ActionScript
<br>
<br>Thanks for visiting! There's nothing more to see for now. Check out my <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/junebeetle">Scratch page</a> and my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/junebeetle23">Google Site</a>.</p>
