      <h2>Welcome to my new website!</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm junebeetle!

As you may know, I've had a <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/junebeetle23">Google Site</a> for my Scratch to SWF converter for a while. That was very useful (thanks Google!) but I really wanted to learn to code a website from scratch. So, over the last couple months, I've been learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Now I'm finally able to write a (very simple) website! And, thanks to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, I can host it online entirely for free. Yay!

At first, this site will pretty just be the same as my Google Site: a place where you can download and use the Scratch to SWF converter. Over time, though, I plan to write some more pages, mostly about my interests in:

- Scratch
- Web design
- Old computer operating systems
- Mac OS X
- AppleScript
- ActionScript

Thanks for visiting! There's not much more to see here for the moment. Maybe you feel like checking out my <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/junebeetle">page</a> on the Scratch website. Or you can try the <a href="converter">Scratch converter</a>.

Have a great day, and don't <a href="http://losethegame.com">lose the game</a>!
