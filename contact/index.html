			<h2>Contact Me</h2>
			<p>If you have a question, comment, compliment, insult, idea, or any other reason to want to talk to me, this is the right place to be. You can ask me for help with something, suggest a change to my website, or report a bug in a program I wrote. You can tell me if I'm wrong or something I've written is unclear. You can even just say hi if you want.

I don't have any sort of social media account, but you can email me or post a comment on my Scratch page. I check both almost daily and I will probably respond within a day or two. My Scratch username is <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/junebeetle/">junebeetle</a> and my email address is <a href="mailto:mailliw128@gmail.com">mailliw128@gmail.com</a>.</p>
