			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<p>If the converter isn't working for you, please read the following tips. If you don't understand how to use the converter, please first read the <a href="/converter/">main converter page</a>.

</p>
	<h3>The converter doesn't load.</h3>
	<p>If you don't see anything, or you see an error message, you may not have a working Flash Player. Try downloading it from <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">here</a>. If you see an alert about a security risk or outdated Flash player, just allow it to run. It is not dangerous and will not make any modifications to your computer.

</p>
	<h3>The SWF won't save.</h3>
	<p>Are you using an incognito window in Google Chrome? If so, there is a bug which stops Flash from saving files. Switch to a standard window or a different browser.

</p>
	<h3>I can't open the SWF, or I get a file other than a SWF.</h3>
	<p>If your computer is unable to find a program to open the SWF with, try using a browser. You can also download a standalone Flash Player; however, it is not usually necessary. Your computer already has a Flash plugin if you can use the converter. Also, be sure to save your file with a SWF extension. For example, name the project "Game.swf" when you save it. If the converted file is already on your computer, you can simply rename it so that it ends in ".swf".

</p>
	<h3>The SWF opens, but it doesn't work.</h3>
	<p>This is the toughest problem to solve. First, ensure that you are converting a valid Scratch project. Try opening it with Scratch to see if it is corrupted. If it is an SB (Scratch 1.x) file, try opening it in Scratch 2 and then saving it again in the new SB2 format. Then, try converting the project with the default settings. Don't check any boxes or change the width and height. Updating your Flash Player or browser may also help.

</p>
	<h3>Something else.</h3>
	<p>If these tips don't help you or you're having a problem not mentioned here, there's still a chance that I can figure it out. Why not <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>?
